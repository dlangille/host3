# Supermicro SC846E16 (20 x 3.5" drive bays)
Information about the server I'm selling.

I'm not sure if I will keep the SSDs or not.

I can sell the chassis separate from the drives.

At one time, the host was as described here: https://dan.langille.org/2022/12/31/slocum-8/ and summarized here:

* M/B –  Supermicro LGA2011/Intel C612 ATX Server X10SRA-F-O (need to
  confirm that's what it is) - included with chassis
* RAM – 64GB
* CPU – CPU E5-1630 v3 @ 3.70GHz (4 cores)
* chassis – SC846E16-R1200B - $500
* SAS2308 card connects the backplane of the chassis with the M/B - operating in IT mode (included with chassis)
* HDD – 20x Toshiba 5TB drives - $45 each

smartctl information nto be added later

FreeBSD installed now. I'll wipe the drives.

I'd prefer local pickup, because shipping is so much work....
